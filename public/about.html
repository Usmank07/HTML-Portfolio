<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Usman Khan, I am currently a student at the CUNY College of Staten Island, and I am currently studying 
  to get my Bacholer's in Computer Science. I love to study different languages in my free time to see how different 
  applications apply to different concepts. It's very interesting. I want to someday work at a big tech corporation 
  like Nvidia or Apple.

<p>One of my favorite hobbies is going to the gym to work on myself. I always want to keep my mind busy so in my free time,
  I love to read books. One of my favorite books is "Dark Psychology and Manipulation" as it is very cool to understand how 
  people can control human behavior by using emotionally influenced techniques. It also goes in depth about body language 
  techniques. I recommend this book as it is very interesting.

<p>One of my biggest passions is day trading as I love to analyze the stock market and trying to study the patterns of how 
  the market works. One thing I recommend to everyone is to invest the money they don't need. Instead of it sitting in your checking
  account, watch your money grow. With the way AI is moving, it might be our only form on income soon.
